About Me – Long Version
I’m Zoe Smith, the hands (and heart) behind Zobosmitty Nailz. For the last 15 years, I’ve worked in the tech world—solving problems, leading teams, and helping businesses grow. But along the way, I found myself craving a creative outlet, something that was completely my own.

That’s when nails found me. What started as a hobby quickly became my obsession—an art form where I could merge detail, design, and self-expression. Creating nails became my therapy, my joy, and my way of connecting with others.

Zobosmitty Nailz is my leap into turning that passion into something bigger. Every set I make is designed to be more than just nails—they’re tiny works of art, made to empower you, spark confidence, and let your personality shine. My mission is to make show-stopping nails accessible to everyone, without the time or cost of the salon, and to share the same joy they’ve brought me. Each set is reusable, cost-effective, and meant to be treasured—just like a favourite piece of jewellery.


About Me – Short Homepage Version
From 15 years in tech to creating art you can wear—Zobosmitty Nailz was born from my passion for turning nails into miniature masterpieces. Each set is handmade with love, designed to be worn, re-worn, and cherished—just like a favourite piece of jewellery.

Our press-ons are durable, reusable, and cost-effective, giving you salon-quality style without the time or price tag. Whether you’re after a bold statement or subtle sophistication, these are nails you’ll want to collect, not just wear once.


Micro-Tagline Options
1. Art you can wear again and again.
2. Statement nails without the salon spend.
3. Reusable. Collectable. Unforgettable.
4. Your nails, your story—on repeat.
5. From passion to polish—made for you.
